A personal portfolio-turned-contact-page, also an experiment into how lean such a website can get.

Previously I was satisfied to get it down to 10kB gzipped at first load, but now with projects (and images) removed it's nothing to brag about anyway.

No svelte actually used at runtime; I only utilized it as a templating engine. Sorry, not sorry ðŸ˜Ž
